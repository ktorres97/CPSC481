Source code for minesweeper game that we used: https://jackfolsom.weebly.com/projects.html 

If the Pygame, Random, and Time libraries are not already installed on your device then the user must install

pip install pygame
pip install time
pip install random

Once this is done navigate to the directory that minesweeper.py is in via command prompt and run 
the command python minesweeper.py.
it can also be ran in visual studio if the user wants to use that to run it.
